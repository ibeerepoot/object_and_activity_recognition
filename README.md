# 🎯 Object & Activity Recognition App

[![Streamlit App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Launch%20App-Click%20Here-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://ex-oar.streamlit.app/)

This interactive app helps users extract **object types**, **activities**, and **objects** from unstructured or semi-structured textual data (e.g., window titles), with support from **GPT-4.1** and domain knowledge.

Designed for **desk-oriented workers**, the tool supports the generation of **object-centric event logs** for process mining or other analysis purposes.

## 🚀 Try the App

👉 [Launch the app](https://ex-oar.streamlit.app/)

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Step-by-step guidance** through 5 interactive stages:
  1. Identify object types  
  2. Identify activities  
  3. Detect concrete object instances  
  4. Enrich window titles with objects & activities  
  5. Export structured results as JSON

- Use **predefined options** or generate domain-specific data using **OpenAI's GPT-4.1**

- Lightweight, **privacy-preserving** local use: user data is never stored or shared

- Designed for integration with **object-centric event log generation pipelines**
